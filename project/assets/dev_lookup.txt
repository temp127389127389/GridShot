z values:
11 - ui
10 - game bomb explosion
9 - flash + stun screen
8 - environment
7 - explosion
6 - own direction marker
5 - smoke cloud
4 - tripwire + game bomb
3 - other's direction marker
2 - player
1 - bullets + throwable projectiles
0 - background map




TODO
 # setup smoke grenade + smoke cloud
 # smoke grenade + cloud multiplayer
 # do some soultion to a billion rpc funcs
 # improve weapon + throwables class scalability (reuse same code but with diff (...).rpc_id(1))
 # separate throwables weapons vs throwables projectiles
 # maybe do a base class for throwable projectiles movement
 # move the PackedScenes in globals to a dict
 # implement the z value list (remember disable z-relative)
	 will fix the direction marker being visible during flash due to always on top
 # flash add a white indicator that the screen froze
 # i added players to auto join group players through node inspect
	 ensure this works
 # tripwire preview, projectile and active z values
	 tripwire path line below tripwire connectors
 # the preview stuff shouldnt be updated every frame
 - when tripwire finished: remove the tripwireconnector selfmodulate synchs
 # there's lag on first time spawn synching smoke and flash grenade
 # try to do physics process stuff on all peers to prevent stuttering
	 eg. projectiles, bullets, player repulsion
 # spinnning while spawning bullets cause synch lag
 # the flash and stun are fucked
 - lag on first flash
 # implement ui into new camera system
 - (?) make tripwire base its events on body entered/body left rather than time
 # redesign the flash texture
 - remember deal with how game get_player works with game_team_menu
 - kick all unsorted players on game start
 - make game_team_menu player section scale properly
 - ensure the removal of team menu player bars works
 - add label to tell players that those in unsorted get kicked on game start
 - add lobby host kick in team menu
 - what happens on WebRTC timeout? the instance queue_frees itself but what of the loading screen
 - game team menu join button highlight on hover
 # on any Webrtc fatalerror go back to main menu
 # accepting new players
